# Light travels at 3 * 10^8 meters per second. A light-year is the distance a light beam travels in one year.
# Write a program that calculates and displays the value of a light-year. Write a program that takes as input a number of kilometers and prints the corresponding number of nautical miles. Use the following approximations:
# • A kilometer represents 1/10,000 of the distance between the North Pole and the equator.
# • There are 90 degrees, containing 60 minutes of arc each, between the North Pole and the equator.

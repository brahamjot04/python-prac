# With the help of suitable program, elaborate compilation and linkking process in Python.

# Compilation and Linking in Python
# Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code is executed line by line.
# There is no separate compilation step in Python, as in languages like C or C++.
# However, Python does compile the source code into bytecode before executing it.
# This compilation step is done automatically by the Python interpreter, and the user does not have to do anything to trigger it.
# The bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
# The PVM is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and executing the instructions.
# The linking process in Python involves importing modules and packages that are needed by the program.
# When a Python program imports a module or package, the Python interpreter searches for the module or package in the directories specified by the sys.path variable.
# If the module or package is found, it is loaded into memory and its contents are made available to the program.
# If the module or package is not found, the Python interpreter raises an ImportError exception.
# The linking process in Python is dynamic, which means that modules and packages can be imported at runtime, and the imported modules and packages can be used immediately.
# This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in Python programs.
# In summary, the compilation and linking process in Python is automatic and dynamic, and is handled by the Python interpreter and the Python Virtual Machine.
